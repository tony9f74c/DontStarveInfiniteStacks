# Infinite Stacks for Don't Starve Together

Display the <b>actual numbers</b> for stacks higher than 999.

Make some items able to be stacked (animals, Guardian's Horn, Tallbird Egg, etc.).

Make animals and insects not require feeding to stay alive in the inventory.

Disable the option to murder animals and insects in the inventory.

Stacked animals are reduced to 1 if dropped on the ground. If you want to release them, do it 1 at a time.
